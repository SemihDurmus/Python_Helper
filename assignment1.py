#Task : Let's say you left a message in the past that prints a password you need.
# To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you.

#Write a program that

#Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,
#Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours,
#print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",

#If the name the user entered is not the same as yours,
#print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."

initial_name = "Joseph"

given_name = input("Enter your name : ")

given_name = given_name.title()

if initial_name == given_name:
    print(f"Hello, {initial_name}! The password is : W@12")
else:
    print(f"Hello, {given_name}! See you later.")
